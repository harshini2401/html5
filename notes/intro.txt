HTML stands Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used for the structure of web pages
WWW (world wide Web ) started by Tim Berner's Lee
Markup languages are not programming language.
Tim BErner's Lee started HTML in 1992. Initially, we used to GML(Generalized Markup Language) 
==>SGML(standard GML)=>HTML
We are in current version HTML5
There is one organization to care HTML i.e., W3C(world wide web consoritum)

<!-- This is a basic HTML to Print My name  -->
 <!-- indentation means left side gaps to make code multilevels-->
<!-- VS Code provides so many shortcuts , these are called Emmets. -->
 <!-- Emmet to get sample HTML code is !+enter or html:5 + enter-->

 <!DOCTYPE html> <!--this line means following document is HTML -->
 <html lang="en"><!-- it is html open tag , -->
 <head> <!-- head opening tag, head is used for meta data, data about data-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"><!-- it represents my code uses unicode tranmission format character set-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- viewport means what you see in screen-->
    <title>PRASAD</title><!-- title will be visible in tab section-->
 </head>
 <body>
    <!-- Actual code will be inside body-->

Headings:
    Headings are used to print headings into web page. There are 6 headings available in html named as h1 to h6. the key difference is size
<h1>Hello Headings</h1>
    <h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
    <h3>Hello 3</h3>
    <h4>Hello 4</h4>
    <h5>Hello 5</h5>
    <h6>Hello 6</h6>
For Better SEO, it is always recommanded to use only one h1 per page
paragraphs: paragraph uses p tag and to generate default paragraph , we can use emmet 'lorem' in VSCode
Anchor tag:
To give refernce to another web pages, we use anchor tags. there are 2 basic attributes of anchor tag. they are href and target
href--> hyper reference is used to give reference links
target ---> target is used to open the link in new tab
img : img is used for images with two basic attributes such as src and alt.
src is used to give th image link
alt- alternate text only works when src is not loaded
