Table is a representation of data in rows and columns
Eg: screener,crickbuzz, amazon comparison
table is done by table tag
inside the table, we can define tr - table rows
Inside tr, we can give td(table data) or th(table head)
by default th will be bold and centered

To combine rows , we can use an attribute rowspan="no_of_rows"
To combine columns, we can use an attribute colspan="no_of_columns"

we can give border by border attribute of table
we give give gap inside the cells using an attribute cellpadding
we can give gap outside / between the cells using an atrribute cellspacing
